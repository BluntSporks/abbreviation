# abbreviation
Reusable Golang library to provide functions to check the validity of abbreviations

## Purpose
To list all abbreviations that I use in programs for reference.

## Status
Ready to use

## Rules
### Sound
* Abbreviations should be pronounceable.
* Abbreviations should have at least one vowel.
* Abbreviations should not split up plosive/liquid combinations, for example, the pr in represent or the tl in template.
* Abbreviations should split up a plosive/plosive combination, for example, the ct in dictionary or pt in caption,
  especially where the original t is pronounced sh in tion.

### Spelling
* Abbreviations should not have more than three consonants in a row.
* Abbreviations should usually end in a consonant, unless the vowel is needed for discrimination, for example, alg and algo.
* All of the letters in the abbreviation should be present in the long form and in the same order.
* The letters of the abbreviation need not appear in sequence in the long form, for example, recv and receive.

### Length
* A abbreviation should be less than or equal to half the length of the original form.
* Abbreviations should be at least three letters long.

### Meaning
* Abbreviations should not be whole words that mean something else.
* Abbreviations should not just consist of the prefix of a word, for example, sym for symbol or syl for syllable.

### Interpretation
* Abbreviations shouldn't be ambiguous. However, if the names are different that no confusion can result, they are OK.

### Origin
* Abbreviations should be compatible with the Google Go language. They should be ideally already used in Go code.
* Abbreviations should be used for common words, since it little helps to abbreviate rare words.
* Abbreviations should be verified at [AllAcronyms.com](http://www.allacronyms.com/) as being in common use.
* Abbreviations should come from the world of IT, technology, and computers, and already be used there.

### Usage
* You can add s to an abbreviation to form the plural, as long as it doesn't end in s.
* You should not add d to form past tense.

### Acronyms
* Acronyms are OK in identifier names, but the acronym should already be well known. They are not listed here.
* Acronyms should be in consistent case, all-lower or all-upper, as recommended in
  [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments). I prefer all caps for all acronyms,
  for example, ServeHTTP or HTTPServer.
* Do not run acronyms together, for example, SQLID or FTPHTTP, since it is hard to read.
* Acronyms should be at least three letters long.

### Exceptions
There are a few exceptions to the above rules for common, well-established forms.
* ct and pt can be used for ction and ption if the abbreviation would be too short otherwise, for example, act and opt.
* x can be used for trans even though it is not a letter of the word.
* Some whole words are OK, such as fact for factorial.
